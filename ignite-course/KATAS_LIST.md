# Codewars Katas

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a site where you can practice your JavaScript skills by solving katas. Katas are ranked from 8 - 1 with 8 being the easiest level. To solve the katas you are generally asked to implement a function that solves a problem.

 You will need to use everything you've learnt so far:

- Numbers, strings, booleans
- Maths operators ( / * + - = )
- Equality operators ( === !== < > <= >= )
- Arrays
- Objects
- Array methods (pop, push)
- For loops
- 'For in' loops
- Functions
- the .forEach method
- the .map method

and lots more! Use [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to learn about other methods that you can use on different data types. String methods such as slice, indexOf, split etc will be very useful. So will array methods such as reverse, sort, indexOf, split and join.

If you don't know how to do something, Google it. 99% of the time, the question has already been asked and answered before.
